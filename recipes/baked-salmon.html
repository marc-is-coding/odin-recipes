  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    This baked salmon recipe is a quick and easy dish featuring salmon fillets
    cooked in a creamy tomato sauce. The preparation takes only 10 minutes,
    and the oven does the rest, leaving you free to cook noodles or rice as a
    side. The sauce combines ingredients like cream, tomatoes, onions, garlic,
    and fresh herbs such as oregano, thyme, and parsley, creating a rich and
    flavorful base. Cherry tomatoes add a fresh touch to the dish.
  </p>
  <p>
    The salmon can be baked directly from frozen (with a slightly longer
    cooking time) or thawed beforehand. Simply place the salmon in a baking
    dish, cover it with the prepared sauce, and bake at 160째C (320째F) for
    approximately 25 minutes. Serve it with pasta or rice for a complete meal
    that's perfect for families, couples, or singles looking for a simple yet
    delicious dinner.
