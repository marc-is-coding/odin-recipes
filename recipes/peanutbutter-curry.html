  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    This meal is a simple and flavorful vegetable curry made with fresh or
    frozen vegetables, curry paste, coconut milk, and a spoonful of peanut
    butter. It’s incredibly easy to prepare, even for beginners, and delivers
    bold flavors with minimal effort. The dish is highly flexible, allowing
    you to use any vegetables you have on hand, such as broccoli, zucchini,
    carrots, or bell peppers. The vegetables are cooked briefly to retain
    their crunchiness, and the curry is topped with optional garnishes like
    yogurt, fresh cilantro, and nuts for added flavor.
